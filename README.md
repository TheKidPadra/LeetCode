# Overview
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in both C++ and Python. The goal is to solve one problem every day (You know just for fun) until I tackle every challenge on the [LeetCode website](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).

# Project Structure
>Ôºë. cpp_solutions: This directory contains C++ solutions for each problem. Each file is named after the corresponding LeetCode problem Name.cpp. You can also find LeetCode problem's ID using the table below.
>
>Ôºí. python_solutions: Similar to the C++ directory, this one contains Python solutions for each problem.

# Getting Started 

>Ôºë. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/TheKidPadra/LeetCode.git
